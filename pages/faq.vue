        FAQ

      <h4>When should I move to 19x19?</h4>
      <p>
        Whenever you feel like to. That said, the sooner you do it, the faster you will improve overall. 9x9 is not considered to be the main board size, so all of the learning resources that you would find will be tailored to 19x19.

      <h4>How do the ranks work?</h4>

      <p>Go uses the Asian martial art system in which the ranks go as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Beginners start at the highest available Kyu rank, usually 25 Kyu (25k for short) online</li>
        <li>They advance "down" towards 1k, and then graduate as 1 Dan (1d for short)</li>
        <li>Dan ranks advance up to the highest available Dan rank, usually 9d online</li>
        <li>The highest Dan rank may be strong enough to play Professionals, but it's not always true</li>
        <li>Professions have their own ranking system which doesn't reflect their strength, but rather their tournament achievements</li>
        <li>Pro ranks start at 1 Professional Dan (1p for short) and advance up towards 9p</li>
        <li>Since strength isn't directly reflected through Professional ranks, it is very much possible for a 1p to be stronger than a 9p. As well as two 9p having a fairly one-sided record of games</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>When am I not a beginner anymore?</h4>
      <p>It's a personal opinion. However, it's generally considered that those weaker than 20k on OGS are "complete beginners".</p>

      <h4>How strong is an "intermediate" player?</h4>
      <p>"Intermediate" is a term used on this website to refer to "Single Digit Kyu" (SDK) players - those between 9k and 1k</p>

      <h4>How strong is an "advanced" player?</h4>
      <p>"Advanced" is a term used on this website to refer to Dan players - those between 1d and 9d</p>
