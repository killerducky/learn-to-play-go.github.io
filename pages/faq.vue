        FAQ
      </h1>
      <h4>How does the time system work?</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>There are 4 commonly used time systems for playing Go online: <strong>Japanese byo-yomi</strong>, <strong>Canadian byo-yomi</strong> and <strong>Fischer time</strong></li>
        <li>
          The most popular system online, <strong>Japanese byo-yomi</strong>, gives each player <strong>main time</strong> (commonly 5-10 minutes) which upon reaching zero starts the <strong>byo-yomi periods</strong> (commonly 3-5 periods of 15-30 seconds)<br>
          If a move is made during the period, it refreshes the period (e.g. back to 30 seconds)<br>
          If a move isn't made during the period, upon reaching zero one period is subtracted<br>
          If there are no periods left and the player reaches zero time, they lose the game on time
        </li>
        <li>
          You can read about the other time systems <a href="https://senseis.xmp.net/?TimeSystem" target="_blank">here</a>
        </li>
        <li>It is worth mentioning that due to the varied length of games, absolute time is almost never used, unlike in Chess</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>How do the ranks work?</h4>

      <p>Go uses the Asian martial art system in which the ranks go as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Beginners start at the highest available Kyu rank, usually 25 Kyu (25k for short) online</li>
        <li>They advance "down" towards 1k, and then graduate as 1 Dan (1d for short)</li>
        <li>Dan ranks advance up to the highest available Dan rank, usually 9d online</li>
        <li>The highest Dan rank may be strong enough to play Professionals, but it's not always true</li>
        <li>Professions have their own ranking system which doesn't reflect their strength, but rather their tournament achievements</li>
        <li>Pro ranks start at 1 Professional Dan (1p for short) and advance up towards 9p</li>
        <li>Since strength isn't directly reflected through Professional ranks, it is very much possible for a 1p to be stronger than a 9p. As well as two 9p having a fairly one-sided record of games</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>When should I move to 19x19?</h4>
      <p>
        Whenever you feel like to. That said, the sooner you do it, the faster you will improve overall. 9x9 is not considered to be the main board size, so all of the learning resources that you would find will be tailored to 19x19.
