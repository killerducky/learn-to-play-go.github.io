When nothing special is going on, repeat this mantra: corners > sides > center. If you still don't know where to play then play the longest open side. After all there is the most space to get points.

And because corners are so great, the most common next move is try and take away something from one of opponent's corners, or make one of your own really big.

A-F would be proboably the most common moves, but there is many other options! We will be focusing just on a few to illustrate some basic ideas, but that does not mean you cannot play elsewhere.]
(;B[de]C[If you want to prevent White from getting a big corner this is one of the common moves. What follows is a common <a data-hover="An established sequence of moves that is believed to be fair for both sides" class="sgfLink">joseki</a>.

(;B[ce]C[B is a similar idea to A, preventing white from getting a big corner with the next move. It is just less influence oriented and more territorial move.];W[cd]C[This is another common <a data-hover="An established sequence of moves that is believed to be fair for both sides" class="sgfLink">joseki</a>.

White protects a nice part of the corner and black gets some compensation on the side.];B[de];W[fc]

(;B[op]LB[cf:A][qc:B]C[If your plan is to build something of your own rather than try and limit white's potential this would be a common move.

White's most common responses would probably be building something of his own around A, or invading your other corner at B.])
(;B[oq]C[This might seem a little passive for nowadays fashion, but this move creates a decent (and very secured) corner.])
(;B[np]LB[cf:A][qc:B]C[This is a move hoping for a big developement. For now White's most common answers would still probably be somewhere around A or B, but White will probably attempt to invade the corner at some later point. It is not yet too secured as the stones are so far apart.])
(;B[nq]C[Similar idea to E, just a tiny bit more secured]))
