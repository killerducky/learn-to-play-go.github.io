White has to play elsewhere so she chooses to put your upper stones into atari by playing at E9 (to try and force you to not fill the ko). We call this move a ko-threat. What now?]

retake the ko (the position is now different than before). 
Now it is you who cannot retake the white stone immediately and 
have to play elsewhere once. The hard part of course is judging 
which option is better in any given situation.])
