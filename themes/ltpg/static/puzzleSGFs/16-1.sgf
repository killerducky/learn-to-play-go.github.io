;W[fq]C[This is one of the most classic examples of overconcentration. Black spent 4 moves in a single corner. That corner is now safe, that's true. It is also big, no doubt. However while black was busy making sure his corner is really super safe, white got influence over the rest of the board. For the rest of the game black will be fighting to reduce white's potential enough to stay in the game. It will be a very tough fight.

Spending too much time at a single area of a board (especially if it is not being attacked) is too ineffective.])
