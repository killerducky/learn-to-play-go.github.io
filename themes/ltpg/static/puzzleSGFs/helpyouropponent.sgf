(;GM[1]FF[4]AP[Drago:4.23]CA[UTF-8]SZ[19]AW[kc][lc][ic][hc]AB[id][jd][kd]C[Let's imagine a simplified situation like this. Black to play. In my early days I would have probably played at A thinking:
- I am reducing by 1 point in sente. (Not much but still a sure reduction) and I am in control of the game, white has to answer my moves so I am "on top"

Right? Right?]LB[jc:A];B[jc]C[Wrong. Well black really is reducing by 1 point in sente, that part is correct. That would have been fine in late endgame, but not before. Also note that white has NO WISH to play at 1 any time soon. It is a 1 point gote move for him/her so chances are you will still get to play this move in endgame if nothing better comes up.];W[jb]LB[hd:1][ie:2][je:3][ke:4][ld:5]C[By playing here black lost much more than he/she gained.

- Black lost a ko threat. This move could have been a very good ko-threat for any potential ko bigger than 1 point. Are you losing kos? Now you know why.

- Black lost a liberty. That group had 6 at the start. Now it is 5. Sounds minor? It's not.

- Black lost any potential for a better attack/reduction];B[mb]C[Lost potential for a better attack you say? Yes, imagine for example that later black gets a stone here. At this point there is not much to do.];AE[jc][jb]C[But had black not exchanged the original two stones.];W[fc]
;B[jb]C[Black might want to peep here instead.];W[jc]
;B[ka]C[That can be much better than 1 point reduction.

This was just an abstract example, but the thought should be aplicable universaly. Do not only think about what a move gets you. Think about what it costs you also.

There is saying: Do not push unless you plan to cut.

If you do, you might be losing a chance for a better attack, you might be losing a needed liberty, you might be losing a required ko threat... And all this for 1 point that you might have gotten anyway? NOT a good deal.])
