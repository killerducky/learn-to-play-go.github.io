;W[dp]C[Most normally both players claim one corner each with 3-3 or 3-4 stone. Any of us could do that, right?];B[fq]L[qp]C[Because of A being closer to the edge this was the biggest open side. Just count them yourself. 12 lines of open space. 

This move hopes to:

- pressure the white corner stone a bit and reduce it's potential
- if possible develop the potential of own framework together with A]LB[ep:1][fp:2][gp:3][hp:4][ip:5][jp:6][kp:7][lp:8][mp:9][np:10]
[op:11][pp:12];W[hq]
;B[oq]TR[fq]LB[fo:1][cq:2]C[3-4 stones are often regarded as more urgent that 4-4. with a 3-4 you can completely secure a decent corner with another stone. 4-4 would still have weaknesses.

But we said urgent before big, did we not? Is the triangled stone not in urgent need of help?
Not really. It has sort of a miai to solve troubles. It can run away with 1 or live in the corner with 2. We can afford letting a bit of pressure on it as the big corner is a good compensation.];W[qj]SQ[oq][qp]C[This move is not too modern nowadays, but the idea behind it still stands. Now that black has an enclosure to his corner it is regarded as very urgent to limit his developement to the other side as well. It would be way too good for black as it would be too easy to develop a big sqare of potential territory.];B[ql]TR[qj]CR[qp][qo][qn][qm][ql]LB[fp:A]C[This one space jump is complete classic. We force white to back off a bit and get a decent developement in sente.

Why does white feel obligated to respond here? Isn't it also a miai situation to run or live? Play A to see.]
(;W[qf]LB[qh:A]C[So white creates a base for his/her stones while simultaneously pressuring the corner stone a bit. The two space jump would also be absolutely normal in this situation.
This leaves a weakness at A. Both players are of course aware of it.];B[mc]C[And black backs off. Simply, calmly, getting some strength, before attacking.];W[rd]C[White also gets some strength for his stones, while reducing black's big corner at the same time.];B[qh]MA[qj]C[Black pressures the weakness. And what follows will be a great example of calm play. Hand's up, who would now jump (or do something) with that lone white stone? I would...
But no.];W[of]C[White gets strength first. Threatening to completely invade the corner.]MA[oc];B[qc]C[Black protects.];W[pi]C[And NOW, only after white has gotten a stronger group to push against, he counter attacks that black stone. CALM! There was nothing too fancy going on there! No super complicated reading, no tricks. White just stayed calm, and first prepared the right moment. 

You cannot attack with a wet noodle as they say.];B[cq]C[Now black has time to go back resolve the situation that was kind of urgent. Avoid too much pressure being put onto this stone.];W[dq];B[cp]
;W[do]C[See? Solid connection, calm... I bet some of you would be tempted to hane here, but that leaves a nasty cut and black does have a stone on the other side...];B[dr]
;W[er]C[Don't let black connect.];B[cr]
;W[eq]C[And protect. Solidly, simply, nothing fancy. Avoid any future problems.];B[cn]L[co]C[White does not push at A (remember most common mistakes chapter?)];W[kq]MA[fq]C[Does this look slow and small to us amateurs? It might. Observe how calm and disciplined pros are. No fancy fast moves. A bit of territory, a base for our group should black manage to save the lone stone a nice potential to develop a big sqare should black fail to safe that lone stone. Avoiding any future problems. That's not small.];B[cf]C[Nothing urgent on the board now? Let's solve the last corner. Again, nothing any of us could not do, right?];W[fc];B[bd]
;W[cc]C[The simplest joseki of all. It is also not too modern anymore, but you absolutely should know it.];B[dh]
;W[em]MA[cl]CR[fm][gm][hm][im][jm][km][kn][ko][kp][kq][kr][ks]C[Check out this move. So beautifull.
Threatening to either ruin black's potential territory, or to create a huge territory/moyo for white. It is nothing complicated. Simple binary (AND FAIR) choice for both. You take yours and I take mine, or neither of us gets too much. 

A professional move will NEVER be I take everything and you get nothing. That's not how go works. Both players have the same ammount of moves. Both are entitled to something. You just have to take a little more. Like haggling on a market. You do not steal the fish... You offer a little bit less than you are willing to pay...];B[fo]
;W[gp]LB[hm:A]C[And again. White is not trying to kill EVERYTHING by capping at A or something like we might consider. It might work... But are you sure about it? White offers a fair change instead. Let me connect up and run away with your stone, or have them all chased around the board.];B[jc]C[And black takes the time to develop last open side. A move I am sure my SDK friends would be saying: "But it is gote" "That's too slow!". Such a simple move. A two space extension, no fancy covert attack, no special reading. How come it is good enough for pros?

Because pros have discipline. Black knows his black group is slowly getting surrounded from both sides and still has weakness around O17. It would not die, but white would get a good result by pushing it around. Black just fixed all potential future problems AND got some territory at the same time. By playing the simplest most obvious solid move.]MA[nc][oc];W[cm]L[bo]C[Ruin black's potential in sente. If black ignored the whole corner might get into trouble. (peep at A)];B[bn]
;W[rc]C[Again a very simple and solid move. Threatening to reduce heavily if ignored.];B[mq]C[Black choses similarily simple move, threatening to develop a very big corner.];W[oc];B[od];W[qb];B[pb];W[pc]
;B[ob]LB[nc:A]C[Another extension would be a mistake.]
(;W[qd]C[White has to take here.];B[nc]
;W[ko]C[This comment is for the double digit kyus among you :) see how white just ignores the two stones in atari? they are small. Keeping sente for much bigger move is the way to play.];B[dn];W[en]
;B[ol]C[Just a big gote move. Nothing fancy.];W[cj]C[This move threatens to take away the eyespace of the black group.];B[ci]C[So black simply protects it. Nothing more complicated needs to happen.];W[ei]
;B[jm]SQ[jn][im][hl][gk][fj]C[And reduction. RIGHT above sectore line. Completely textbook.];W[lm]C[And this starts the first real fight. We can assume that white felt allowing the reduction would be too bad of a position for him, so he tries to cut off the reducing stone from the rest.];B[jk]C[Blacks threatens to connect back to something.];W[lk]C[White keeps the separation.];B[gm]C[Black to try and gain some eyespace.];W[ji]LB[kj:A]SQ[pi][qj][of][qf]C[And white to completely surround.
The weakness at A is not a huge concern as even if black manages to break out through there he will still be headed towards white's strength.];B[hj];W[hh];B[kj]
;W[lh]C[Check out the beutifull patience. White surrounds from a distance as not to give black anything to attack. Black has nowhere to run.];B[go];W[fp]
;B[io]CR[hn][in][im][il][ik][hk][hl][hm]SQ[hh][ji][lh][lk][lm][ko][kq][hq][gp][fp][en][ei]C[And black to protect some eye space as not to die. Black is pretty much alive now. White will not be able to kill. Another mistake we amateurs sometimes do is regarding situations like these a failure. White failed to kill, but not without compensation. Look at all the strength white got while black made close to 8 points. White has a good position now to reduce or make own points. The game is still almost 50/50.];W[qq]C[This is what we call a probe. The move does not really hope to achieve something on itself, but to prepare some forcing moves we can hope to use later to get advantage elsewhere. Just shake the tree and see if something falls down.];B[rp]

[ro][qo][qn][rn][rm][qm][pm][pn][po][oo][op][np]C[Huge reduction, this was urgent. Black would have too much otherwise.];B[ml];W[ll]
;B[ni]C[From here in ot starts to get a little complicated requiring some advanced reading and counting. I do not think it would be too beneficial (or possible) for me to try and explain all the moves. But look at the move count. It took 73 moves to even start getting "really" complicated. Untill then it was all simple, elegant, fair solid moves.];W[nk];B[ok];W[nj];B[oj];W[oi];B[nh];W[mi];B[mg];W[oh];B[eo]
