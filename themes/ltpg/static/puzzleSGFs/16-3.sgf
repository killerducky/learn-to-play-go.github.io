For simplicity consider that the stone you just saved was worth 1 point for the prisoner White would get (it is actually even less, because it would be ko). Just playing around A could bring Black several times that. And there might be even bigger move elsewhere. 

Unless the stone is somehow important (keeping your groups connected, or cutting or reducing your opponent severly) one stone is nothing more than a SINGLE point. And the same applies for two or even three stones. Always look for a move that is most profitable. Any sacrifice is justifiable (in Go) if you make even more points elsewhere.])
