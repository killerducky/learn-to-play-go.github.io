(;GM[1]FF[4]AP[Drago:4.23]CA[UTF-8]SZ[19]C[We often talk about territory and influence. I can tell you that a move on the 3rd line is usally territory oriented and a move on the 4th line is influence oriented, but what does that really mean? 

A great example is the 4-4 point which is often used to start a game.
(see next)];B[pd]C[This move guarantees no points in the corner at all. Oppenent can invade the 3-3 point and live there easily. So why is it one of the most common starting moves right now? See the end of the variation.];W[qc];B[pc];W[qd];B[qe];W[re];B[qf];W[rf];B[qg];W[pb];B[ob]

[og:?][pg:?][nb:?]C[This variation is a bit out of fashion nowadays, but it clearly illustrates the difference between territory and influence.

White is now safely alive with about 10 points of territory Black will not be able to take away. So how come black is also fine with this result? It is because while White made some guaranteed points in the corner, her group is now pretty much isolated from the rest of the board and will have not much of a further use. 

Black has no real points so far, but has the strength and chance to fight for a lot of them at the center of the board. His "wall" basically already forms one/two sides of a potentially even bigger center territory.

That's why the result is considered more or less fair for both sides.])
