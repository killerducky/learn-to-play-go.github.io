This is part of a joseki, but never mind that, the principal applies quite universally. In my early days I would have probably played at A thinking:
- I am reducing by 1 point in sente. (Not much but still a sure reduction) and I am in control of the game, white has to answer my moves, so I am "on top", Right?]

LB[ce:A];B[ce]C[Wrong. Well black really is reducing by 1 point in sente, that part is correct. That would have been fine in late endgame, but not before. Also note that white has NO WISH to play at 1 any time soon. It is a 1 point gote move for him/her so chances are you will still get to play this move in endgame if nothing better comes up.];W[be]C[By playing here black lost much more than he/she gained.

- Black lost a ko threat. This move could have been a very good ko-threat for any potential ko bigger than 1 point. Are you losing kos? Now you know why.

- Black lost a liberty. That group had 6 at the start. Now it is 5. Sounds minor? It's not.

- Black lost any potential for a better attack/reduction. The corner is now quite safe and connected. (See next)]LB[ed:3][ea:1][fb:2][ee:4][df:5];B[cg]C[Lost potential for a better attack you say? Yes, imagine for example that later black gets a stone here. At this point there is not much to do apart from putting that one stone into atari. However, if the original exchange was not there... (see next)];AE[ce][be]C[Peep at A threatens the WHOLE corner.]LB[be:A];B[be]LB[bd:A][ce:B]C[White can either protect at A and live in gote.
Or connect to B and get reduced to a single eye.

Now wouldn't you say that is a better result for black than 1 point reduction? The one point is not enough compensation for solving all future problems of your opponent.]
