(;GM[1]FF[4]AP[Drago:4.23]CA[UTF-8]SZ[19]C[Look through A-F which are the most common opening moves.]L[qc][pd][qd][pe][qe][jj]
(;B[qc]LB[pd:A]C[The san-san (3-3) stone.

It was the traditional starting move a long time ago. Now it is a little out of fashion, but you can still see it every now and then.

This stone secures only a small amount of territory in the corner (being so close to the edge) but is super safe. You do not have to worry about this stone and can concentrate on attacking/doing something else.];W[pd]C[One of the most common responses...];B[qd];W[pe];B[ob]
;W[md]C[One of the possible follow-ups. White forces black to take a small corner and hopes for a bigger compensation towards side and center])
(;B[pd]LB[qc:A]C[The hoshi (star point) stone.

A fairly modern move that does not guarantee any points in the corner (opponent can invade 3-3 and live easily). It is saying, 'I will either get a huge corner or get enough compensation on the outside to make up for it'. If you are a more influence (big center moyo) oriented player this move is for you. 

See A for the 3-3 invasion];W[qc]
;B[pc]C[Black will block from either side];W[qd]C[From here there are many variations being played now. I will show you the most straightforward one (even though it is a bit out of fashion nowadays).];B[qe]C[Black to try and enclose white in the corner.];W[re]
;B[qf]C[In special cases black can double hane here, but usually it is better not to.];W[rf]
;B[qg]C[White is already alive and can play elsewhere if she deems it more important.

White got some points in the corner but his/her group will have very little effect on the rest of the board. Black did not make any points so far but his/her strong wall can have a very big influence on the rest of the board and has potential to build a lot of points.])
(;B[qd]C[The 3-4 (famous Shusaku opening move) is sort of a compromise between the 3-3 and 4-4

Saying, 'I want a moderate ammount of territory in the corner but I want to have some influence on the center as well.'])
(;B[pe]C[These moves are also not THAT popular, but still playable. A very center oriented opening. Black is unlikely to get anything in the corner.])
(;B[qe]C[Quite similar to D but threatening a big corner should white not act soon.])
(;B[jj]C[Tengen (center point) is often laughed at as "I don't know what I am doing" move, but it can have it's perks and was also seen in professional games at some point.

It is the move should black want to play mirror go, and also can be beneficial for "fighting style" as most ladders will now be good for black (the black stone is a ladder breaker for any ladder headed to the center)]))
