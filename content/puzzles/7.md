# | Cuts
## What can I tell you, go is an edgy game

> I promised you some tips on capturing things. Well this is one of them. :)

**By cutting an opponent we mean separating his group into two. Or, to put it more precisely, preventing two groups of stones to connect. This is a crutial technique, if you want to put pressure on your opponent. Taking care of one group is easy. Having to take care of two groups (possibly find two eyes for both) at once, now that is not so easy.**

But beware! While separating stones of your opponent you too are usually creating two separate groups. So timing your cuts is important. You should first make sure that your stones are stronger than your opponents. Otherwise you might be the one who will be under a lot of pressure. Check out these puzzles to get the idea.
