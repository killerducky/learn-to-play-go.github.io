# | Passing & Counting
## How to score a game

> This is the last stop. The last thing preventing you from playing a complete game of Go. I am proud of you. It may seem insignificant, but you are THIS close to learning possibly the most complex game a human race knows. I mean you suck at playing it, but at least you almost know the rules...

**The end to the game of Go is not that straightworward as say Chess. The game end when both players feel there is nothing more to gain. Then a player with more points wins (duh)**

{{< rule >}}
	Each player has the right to {{< black "pass">}} (literally say pass) instead of placing a stone.
{{< /rule >}}

{{< rule >}}
	If both player pass {{< black "consecutively">}}, the game is over and we count the score.
{{< /rule >}}

Yes, you got it right. The game can only end when neither player wants to play further.
That sounds easy, but it is also easy to screw it up. So before you pass you should make sure that the game is actually over. That means there is no move that could bring any points. Most notably: 

{{< tsumego >}}

After the game ends (two consecutive passes) we first remove all stones that have no way of preventing capture and add them as prisoners (just to save time of playing out every needless move). This may sound confusing at first, but it really isn't that complicated. See the example below - let's say both players passed in this position.

Any seasoned go player would know that lone black stone has no chance of preventing capture. And if you are not sure, you simply would not pass. It would make no sense to pass in this position if you thought that black stone might survive, because in such a case borders around the respective territories would not be finished yet. 

{{< rule >}}
	You {{< black "do not">}} have to actually capture every last dead stone in your territory. If it cannot live it is counted as a prisoner anyway once we start scoring.
{{< /rule >}}

{{< rule >}}
	Playing inside your own territory when you do not need to {{< black "costs you">}} a point (only empty intersections count for points).
{{< /rule >}}

But to help you recognize dead stones until you gain more experience here are some tips on how dead stones look like:
 
* **▷ It is only a handfull of stones (below 5)**
* **▷ They are not surrounding any territory (that is a huge tell!)**
* **▷ They cannot hope to caputre anything (well connected stones all around)**

But I repeat. If you are not sure, do not pass.

Now we only count the empty spaces that are fully surrounded by stones of one color, add the prisoners and that's it.

Assuming komi (a compensation white gets for black's first move) white wins by 1,5 points (24 points of territory +1 for the prisoner +5,5 for komi against black's 29). In Go the difference between the two matters, not the actual number of points. That one space in the middle? Does not count for either color. Remember only territory fully surrounded by **one** color can be counted. 

And luckily for us who play online, the computer counts it for us :).

And here comes the curveball. But I had to tell you sooner or later. These things I just taught you apply for Japanese scoring... Yeah. Go has several rulesets and Japanese are arguably the most popular in Western Europe. Does that mean you cannot play with someone who was taught Chinese scoring? Luckily, no! All the basic principles are the same, and unless you played something very weird the result will be same as well. So it almost does not matter what rules you know. And if I were you I would not bother with them right now.
