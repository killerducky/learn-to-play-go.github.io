# | What To Do in the Opening
## How do you even start on such a huge board?

> From now on, we will be talking about the 19x19 board. If you are still having fun on 9x9 there is no rush to switch.  

**We do not know much, but are pretty sure you should start in the corners.**

Now that does not mean that if you start in a corner and your opponent doesn't you win automatically, but it should start you in the right direction. Generally speaking we first take the corners, then the sides, and only then start caring about the center. In go there is an exception for everything, but it is very good to keep this general direction in mind.
