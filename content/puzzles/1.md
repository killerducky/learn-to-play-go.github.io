# | Placing the Stones

## This is NOT a Tic-tac-toe

> So you decided to try and learn the game you will actually NEVER be good at? Fine. Your choice. I made the same mistake after all. And in all honesty, it has been a lot of fun. Let me try to get you off to a good start :) Also, I have hidden some secrets here, to keep it fun, be on your guard.

### The stones are played on the **intersections**, not in the "boxes".

### **Black** plays first (this is not chess).

### After that black and white take turns **equally**.

### Once a stone is played it cannot be moved. It can only be removed by getting **captured**.

**Got it? It's not hard, right? Feel free to test out a few moves (for both black and white), you are now already almost good to play! We will talk about capturing in the next chapter.**
