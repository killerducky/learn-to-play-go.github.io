# | Placing the Stones
## This is NOT a Tic-tac-toe

> So you decided to try and learn the game you will actually NEVER be good at? Fine. Your choice. I made the same mistake after all. And in all honesty, it has been a lot of fun. Let me try to get you off to a good start :) Also, I have hidden some secrets here, to keep it fun, be on your guard.

{{< rule >}}
The stones are played on the {{< black "intersections" >}}, not in the "boxes".
{{< /rule >}}

{{< rule >}}
{{< black "Black" >}} plays first (this is not chess).
{{< /rule >}}

{{< rule >}}
After that black and white take turns {{< black "equally">}}.
{{< /rule >}}

{{< rule >}}
Once a stone is played it cannot be moved. It can only be removed by getting {{< black "captured">}}.
{{< /rule >}}

**Got it? It's not hard, right? Feel free to test out a few moves (for both black and white), you are now already almost good to play! We will talk about capturing in the next chapter.**

    But is it not unfair, that black gets the first move? It sure is! To make up for this advantage, white gets several points extra from the start (called komi). 
    It is usually 6,5 points on the 19x19 board and only 5,5 on 9x9. The half points is to prevent ties.
