# | Make Some Shape
## Now even your stones need to be in shape

> Being human, we are unable (and lazy) to read out every possible variation for our stones. Thus playing in such a way that we can be reasonably sure is safe might be a good idea.  

Any stronger player minds the shape of his groups. By shape we understand the formations a group of your stones has and the relation between them.

Now you can be pretty sure that two solidly connected stones will never be separated. However, while it is a good shape, being so close to one another they may not be efficient enough. Thus, we keep an eye for many shapes and try to chose the best one to fit the situation, not the other way around.

**A good shape should do as much of the following as possible:**

{{< rule >}}
	Maintain a {{< black "connection" >}} connection (because it is always easier to have to take care of one group instead of two)
{{< /rule >}}

{{< rule >}}
	Be {{< black "efficient" >}} (you want the best possible effect with the least possible ammount of moves)
{{< /rule >}}

{{< rule >}}
	Create {{< black "eye potential" >}} (so you can live easily)
{{< /rule >}}
 
{{< rule >}}
	Maximize {{< black "liberties" >}} (so you can win capture races)
{{< /rule >}}
