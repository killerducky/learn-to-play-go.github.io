# | Snapback
## A fitting name for once

> Ah, snapback. One of the coolest techniques out there (although not THE coolest). You are doing great. Keep it up and I might even show you the most mindblowing trick we have in Go. But let's focus on the task at hand. 

**A snapback is a situation where capturing a stone does not actually increase the liberties of a group and it remains in atari.**

It may not sound like much, but wait till you see it in action.
 
{{< tsumego >}}

{{< rule >}}
	These are {{< black "NOT a KO!" >}} While you are recapturing with a stone that just got captured, the game position is different and your opponent has no chance of capturing back. 
{{< /rule >}}

With snapback, it is often the case of getting an edge by threatening to create a snapback rather than actually snapping back. Either way, try to look for those in your games. They are not as uncommon occurences as you might think.
