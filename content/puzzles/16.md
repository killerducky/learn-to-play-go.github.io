# | Most Common Beginner Mistakes
## Little pieces of quick advice

> There is nothing true 100% of time in Go. And a lot of things you "learn" not to do can later turn out to be playable in the right situation and vice versa. I urge you take every advice you can get, but not blindly. Use any advice of a stronger player, but think about why and when.   

**Every player is different, but yet, a lot of the mistakes repeat. A clever man learns on mistake of others, so check out what I did wrong when I was starting**

**Urgent before big** - always make sure your groups are safe. Only then look for the biggest move

**Just because it puts a stone an atari, does not mean it is a good move**

**Not every stone is worth saving** - a captured stone is worth 1 point. Possibly +1 for the territory. If the stone is not important (not severely cutting anything or needed for life) just sack it. Surely you can think of a move bigger than 2 points

**Do not try to kill EVERYTHING** - do not be too greedy. If you attack everything it usually means you are also leaving weaknesses everywhere and your whole position may crumble. You only need to get a little more than your opponent everytime.

**Do not be a puppy** - do not just follow your opponent around answering everything he/she does. Look for a time to take iniciative and try to keep it

**Learn to sacrifice something small to get bigger advantage elsewhere**

**In the land of the blind one eyed man is king ;)**

**If you lost, find out why** - from lost games you can learn the most

**A bad move is a punishement in of itself**
