{{< bubble id=text1 shownext="▶" sgf="empty" pic="hi" >}}Hey there, [name], my name is Sam (short for Samurai). This is my favorite game - *Go/. I love it!{{< /bubble >}}

{{< bubble id=text2 shownext="▶" sgf="empty" pic="sad" >}}But I am not very good at it.{{< /bubble >}}

{{< bubble id=text3 shownext="DEAL" sgf="empty" pic="check" >}}Tell you what though, I will teach you the rules, and you will help me get better. Deal?{{< /bubble >}}

{{< bubble id=text4 shownext="▶" sgf="empty" pic="yes" >}}Awesome! Grown-ups like playing on bigger boards, but we will start on a small one. It is more fun and full of exciting fighting.{{< /bubble >}}

{{< bubble id=text5 shownext="none" sgf="1-1" pic="play" >}}You will have black stones, and I will have white. In go, the *black player plays first/ and then we take turns. You can play anywhere you want, but for now try the very center of the board - where E and 5 meet.{{< /bubble >}}
