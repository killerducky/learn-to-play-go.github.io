An amazing project run by a dear friend of mine. Basically a go club, but online. Lectures and reviews by high-dan or even professional players, league games for prizes, lots of friendly advice...
<br><br>

**Video lectures (there are a lot to chose from, so just to cover the basics...)**

Great guy, publishing actual lectures from an American Go club. I think these are great for beginners.

A famous high dan player with highly regarded "Basic series" which focus on the fundamentals. Might be good knowing a bit already before watching.
