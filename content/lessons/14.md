# | The Middle Game
## How to not get completely lost among all the possibilities.

> This will be a tough chapter, full of different concepts. There is no other way. We can condense the opening into several common (best regarded) options. The endgame follows quite a logical sequence of moves. But the middle game? It is where the majority of the moves happens and where you have to fill the huge open space. There is just so many options...

**Let's say you and your opponent split the corners somehow took some of the sides maybe... What now?**

Obviously, there is not a simple answer. It all depends on the context. So let's try to imagine some possible situations and their potential answers. But first we need to introduce some terminology.

{{< extra "Sente-gote" "Sente vs gote" >}}
	<b>Sente</b> - can be loosely translated as initiative. When you have sente, it means you do not feel obligated to answer your opponent's last move, and thus can play anywhere else on the board. Often we also say to "play a move in sente", which means that we are hoping our move will force the opponent to answer locally, and we will keep sente.
	<br><br>
	<b>Gote</b> - is the opposite. Meaning we feel obligated to answer opponent's last move and hence opponent will keep the ability to freely choose where to play next.
	<br><br>
	It is an important concept, and having the chance to freely chose where the game will develop next is certainly an advantage not to be overlooked.
{{< /extra >}}

{{< rule >}}
	Sente moves {{< black "first!" >}}
{{< /rule >}}
If there is unlikely to be any big ko fights be sure to take EVERY sente move you can. Even if it is only 1 point, if your opponent has to answer it is one point for you and nothing for your opponent. Find 10 moves like this and you will have earned 10 points.

{{< rule >}}
	Do {{< black "not" >}} answer every attack blindly.
{{< /rule >}}
During endgame - to have sente means to be making points. Consider sacrificing even a few points (by not answering an attack) to gain sente. It is fine to lose 3 points of territory if you can make 5 points just by gaining sente. If you are only answering you are not gaining any points.

{{< rule >}}
	Once out of sente moves chose the {{< black "biggest" >}} gote play.
{{< /rule >}} 
Obviously. If you have to give up sente, better make it as profitable as possible.

That's it. It is all very logical and easy. Yet I see games every day, where players completely fail to bring home a won game, just because of a complete lack of endgame understanding.

See how big the difference can be even on the 9x9 board? On 19x19 it would be even bigger.
