# | The Middle Game
## How to not get completely lost among all the possibilities.

> This will be a tough chapter, full of different concepts. There is no other way. We can condense the opening into several common (best regarded) options. The endgame follows quite a logical sequence of moves. But the middle game? It is where the majority of the moves happens and where you have to fill the huge open space. There is just so many options...

**Let's say you and your opponent split the corners somehow took some of the sides maybe... What now?**

Obviously, there is not a simple answer. It all depends on the context. So let's try to imagine some possible situations and their potential answers. But first we need to introduce some terminology.

{{< extra "Sente-gote" "Sente vs gote" >}}
	<b>Sente</b> - can be loosely translated as initiative. When you have sente, it means you do not feel obligated to answer your opponent's last move, and thus can play anywhere else on the board. Often we also say to "play a move in sente", which means that we are hoping our move will force the opponent to answer locally, and we will keep sente.
	<br><br>
	<b>Gote</b> - is the opposite. Meaning we feel obligated to answer opponent's last move and hence opponent will keep the ability to freely choose where to play next.
	<br><br>
	It is an important concept, and having the chance to freely chose where the game will develop next is certainly an advantage not to be overlooked.
{{< /extra >}}

You can imagine the middle game as a series of questions you need to answer in the right order. Obviously, there will always be exceptions, but the basic question you should ask yourself might look like this (following the order).

{{< rule >}}
	Do I have a {{< black "weak group?" >}} 
{{< /rule >}}
If you do, you should protect. Otherwise your opponent will attack and either kill your group outright (which can even be game ending), or profit heavily by making points, while you strugle to find two eyes (or connection) making no points in the process. 

**What does a weak group look like?**
It is a group that you do not see a safe way of creating two eyes for, while being close to surrounded by opponent's stones. Another possibile weak group is a group that can be cut apart from the rest.

{{< rule >}}
	Does my opponent have a {{< black "weak group?" >}}
{{< /rule >}}
If so, it should be good to pressure it! Do not be reckless. You do not necessarily have to kill it, even "just" attacking it can give you lots of "free" stuff. Keeping sente in the process is even better if you safely can.

{{< rule >}}
	Can I claim a huge chunk of {{< black "territory" >}} or prevent my opponent from doing so?
{{< /rule >}} 
If there are no weak groups, it is often best to just go for a nice big part of territory, or prevent your opponent from doing the same. Or even better do both at once.

{{< rule >}}
	Who is {{< black "winning?" >}}
{{< /rule >}} 
It is a simple question really, but a lot can depend on an answer. Who has a better potential to win this game right now? If it is your opponent, it's time to try some sort of attack, not just keep protecting. If you are the one with better prospects of winning, do not take it as an excuse to play slack, but stay away from crazy attacks and instead make sure all your territory and groups are safe and solid.

See how big the difference can be even on the 9x9 board? On 19x19 it would be even bigger.
