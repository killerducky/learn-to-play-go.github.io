An amazing project run by a dear friend of mine. It is basically a Go club online. Lectures and reviews by high-dan or even professional players, league games for prizes, lots of friendly advice...

**Video Lectures (there are a lot to choose from, so just to cover the basics...)**

A beloved animated series about a young Go player on his way to professional level. With huge attention to detail and a great selection of actual games, all levels can learn something from watching.
