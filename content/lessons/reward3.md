# | Mistakes, mistakes everywhere
## And I mean everywhere...

> The board is a mirror of the mind of the players as the moments pass. When a master studies the record of a game he can tell at what point greed overtook the pupil, when he became tired, when he fell into stupidity, and when the maid came by with tea.

**And now you are on your own.**

Be free. And thank you for reading this far. Never expected anyone to read so much of my rambling. And now I have nothing more to say. You will have to discover the rest on your own, or with the help of someone else. Check out some video lectures or look for strong players to help you make smaller mistakes. 

Yes, when you think about it a move can never be good in Go. It can only NOT be a mistake when you are lucky (or that good). But don't ever feel bad about bad moves! Even pro players do them, so you can too.

Have fun!
