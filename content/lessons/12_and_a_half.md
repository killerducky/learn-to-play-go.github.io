# | Playing Under the Stones
## What a weird concept

> This is one of those special techniques that actually comes into play like once a year. At most. But man, when you get it right. You're on the top of the world!  

Playing under the stones actually means purposefully sacrificing a small group to get enough space to play there again.
 Sounds confusing? Well the whole technique is quite confusing. But you might understand when you see it.

These are super advanced tricks, and you have to see them way in advance to set it up, so I would not worry too much about this actual technique, it was just a demonstration. But you can't deny the coolness factor, can you?
