# | No Repetition (A rule called "Ko")
## No repetition ever

> Full disclosure - this is a rule that may confuse you at first. Fortunately, it is not as complicated as it may first appear. I for one (although many would disagree) think that a good ko fight is one of the most fun things you can have in a Go game.

**Go games can be really long. However, they must never be endless. To prevent the possibility of an endless game we have a rule called "Ko".**

Just imagine a situation like this one. Given enough stubbornness, those players would be playing until they pass out. (feel free to watch for a while)

To prevent health problems connected with exhaustion, we have this rule:

{{< rule >}}
    A completely identical board position {{< black "must not">}} appear twice in one game.
{{< /rule >}}

{{< rule >}}
Therefore, before you can recapture a stone that just captured yours, you have to {{< black "play elsewhere">}} at least {{< black "once">}}.
{{< /rule >}}

**What are your options then? Basically, you have two:**

⬤  You deem the stone not important and play elsewhere, letting your opponent end the ko by connecting her endangered stone if she wants to.

⬤  You deem the stone important enough to fight the ko. You still have to play elsewhere (of course) but you try to find a move your opponent will feel compelled to respond to locally (we call that a ko-threat). After that, you retake the ko stone and the fight is on!



*Confusing? Then check out the following examples. It will be clear in no time.*

{{< tsumego >}}

{{< alert >}}
    And on 19x19 board, there are usually much more than only one threat, so the ko fight can span over several moves.
	The hard part - of course - is judging if any given threat is big enough to respond to or whether it is more beneficial to end the ko. But hey, I said the rules are easy, not the game itself.
