# | Placing the Stones
## Hard to master, but easy to learn

> Go is a wonderful ancient game and still the most popular boardgame in the World. While it is infamously hard to master all the intricate strategies, learning the rules is easy and should not take more than a few minutes. Go can be enjoyed at any level of ability so these rules are all you need to fully enjoy a match.

Ordinarily, Go is played on a square grid of 19x19 or 9x9 lines with a set of black stones for one player and white stones for the other. The aim of the game is to surround more points than your opponent (but more about that later).

**Feel free to test out a few moves (if you haven't already) for both Black and White. Already, you are almost ready to play Go! We will talk about capturing in the next chapter.
If you really want to know everything, check out the extra information below.**


{{< extra "1" "Compensating the first move" >}}
	Is it unfair, that Black gets the first move? It sure is! To make up for this advantage, White gets several points extra from the start (called komi). 
    It is usually 6.5 points on the 19x19 board and only 5.5 on 9x9. The half points usually prevent ties.

{{< extra "2" "A polite first move" >}}
	It is traditional to play one's first move into the upper right corner of the board. This way a player symbolically bows to his opponent (White is traditionally the stronger player). This habit is still common even in online play.
