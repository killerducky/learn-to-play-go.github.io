## Frequently asked questions about Go rules and other stuff

> Some questions come up repeatadly (and quite naturally) when one is learning the game. If you are not sure about some situation, chances are you will find your answer below

{{< extra "1" "Can't I just throw a random stone to opponent's territory and force him to capture it making him/her lose 4 points?" >}}
	As you probably gathered - it does not work like that (otherwise everyone would be doing it). <br><br>
	As discussed in <a href="/lessons/05"><u>chapter 5</u></a> a <b>stone that cannot survive is counted as a prisoner anyway</b> (even if it remains on the board). Unless the stone is threatening some real harm or capture, your opponent can in fact just ignore the move and get +1 extra point for the prisoner you just gave him. If you then want to argue the stone is alive the game position may be played out, but the score is then counted from the original position after the two passes, not the played out version.

{{< extra "2" "If there are groups at sort of an impasse (neither can capture the other) how is it scored?" >}}
	You are probably talking about "seki", and it is further discussed in <a href="/lessons/12"><u>chapter 12</u></a>

{{< extra "3" "What is kyu and dan / How do the traditional ranks work?" >}}
	As a tradition we use an old Japanese ranking system.
	<br><br>
	<b>Kyu</b> (k for short) - is a "student's" rank. It starts at a high number (most commonly 25k, but it can differ) and as a student grows in strength, the number decreases - 1k being the strongest kyu rank.
	<br><br>
	<b>Dan</b> (d for short) - is a "master's" rank. It starts at a low number (1d being the lowest dan rank - following immediately after 1k) and 6d (usually) being the strongest dan level. Sometimes these are called amateur dan, to differentiate from professional dan levels.
	<br><br>
	<b>Professional dan</b> (p for short) - is a "master's" rank, that is recognized by some of the professional organizations (playing Go is their job). They are usually even stronger than amateur dans, but the skill level can sort of overlap. Pro ranks start at 1p and the strongest obtainable level (not counting honorary titles) is 9p.

{{< extra "4" "There are more rulesets in Go? What are the differences?" >}}
	There are, but it does not really matter right now. The result is usually the same no matter what rules you played under.
	If you are super curious, check out the basic differences <a href="/lessons/rulesets"><u>here</u></a>.

{{< extra "5" "Is it okay to start by playing bots?" >}}
	If you first need to gain some confidence before playing real humans, it is of course fine to test yourslef against a bot in a game or two. However, most of Go players agree that is not a good idea to play them for long. Most servers are full of complete beginners just like you, and many have strong players willing to help you out. Just play them. It is much more exciting, much more fun, and much better learning experience as they can also give you feedback.

{{< extra "6" "What is the bent four rule?" >}}
	It is a rule stating that a group in certain position (under Japanese scoring) is dead even though it may not look like it at first glance. It is causing a lot of confusion that comes from not exploring the position and confusion of terms. It is best explored on a board.<br><br>
