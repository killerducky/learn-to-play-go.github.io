# | Double Atari
## One atari is nice but two ataris at once? Now that's something.

> I promised you some tips on capturing things. Well this is another one :)

**The idea is very simple. If you atari a stone your opponent (unless he's blind) can usually save it. However, if you atari two different stones with one move, then your opponent can save only one and you get to eat the other.**

This was an easy one but good to keep in mind whether attacking or defending. I always caution beginners about three diagonal moves (double hane).

It tends to get cut apart when not protected, just because there is so much stones to atari. However, DO NOT disregard that move completely. Once you learn to read out the cuts it can be a very powerful move when applied correctly. Only do it if you can imagine what will happen when your opponent cuts :).
