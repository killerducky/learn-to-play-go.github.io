# | There Are No Suicides in Go
## Just ruthless captures and willing sacrifices. How nice.

> This rule is very easy and quite logical but it needs to be mentioned. Soon you will play a real game!

**It's simple. You must not kill your own stones and there is a reason I am even telling you this...**

{{< rule >}}
    A stone that would have {{< black "no liberties">}} (or fill the last liberty of your group) must not be placed.
{{< /rule >}}

{{< rule >}}
    {{< black "Unless" >}} the very same move captures something. In that case it is allowed (because the capture gives you at least one liberty).
{{< /rule >}}

{{< tsumego sgf="(;FF[4]GM[1]VW[aa:jj]SZ[9]ST[2]EV[Nï¿½ 1 .|. Level #2]AB[gg][gh][gi][hh][hi][ig][ih][ii][ga][gb][gc][hc][ic]AW[cb][bc][dc][cd][ff][fg][fh][fi][gf][hf][if][ha][hb][ib]C[Like here. You are not allowed to place a stone at A or B. However; you can place a stone at C because you capture something with that move. Try it.]FG[1](;B[cc]C[Correct!])(;B[hg]C[Yes! Simple.])(;B[ia]C[Feels good, right?]TE[1])1" >}}

{{< alert >}}
    Since there can never be a stone without a liberty, it is possible to create an "immortal" group but don't worry if you can't imagine how right now. It is a topic for later.
